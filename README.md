#Data Science Specialization Course Notes

Similar to Xing Su, I have also compiled notes for all 9 courses of the Johns Hopkins Unversity/Coursera Data Science Specialization. 

Doing so on Github, allowed me to get used to the way git works and become a bit more effective when commiting my own work.

Most notes are written in an R-Script or R-Markdow format, and will include the material covered in class as well as any other information gathered through secondary sources souch as StackOverflow, among others.

I first came to this idea after learning Xing su approach. Structuring notes in a organized manner has been key to conducting this specialization.
